My husband and I love visiting art museums; unfortunately are kids do not. So to help them appreciate art, we’ve been reading books by Laurance Anholt to learn more about the actual artist. After we read the book, we’ve been painting picture based on the style of the artist. This idea I borrowed from [@stillfamily](https://www.instagram.com/stillfamily/).

So far the girls love it.
